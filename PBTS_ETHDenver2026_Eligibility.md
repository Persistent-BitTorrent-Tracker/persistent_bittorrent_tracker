# PBTS MVP – ETHDenver 2026 #BUIDLathon Eligibility Summary

**Project Title**  
Persistent BitTorrent Tracker System (PBTS) MVP  
**Based on**  
“Persistent BitTorrent Trackers” academic paper (arXiv:2511.17260v2, 24 Nov 2025)

---

## 1. Strongest Track Alignment

**Primary Track: Futurllama – Frontier Tech & Wild Ideas**  
**Organizer Prize:** $2,000

**Why this is the strongest and most natural fit**  
- Experimental & “wild” idea at the intersection of DePIN, cryptography, and real-world P2P infrastructure  
- Introduces novel primitives for portable, verifiable reputation in decentralized file-sharing networks  
- Directly implements the core PBTS scheme from the published academic paper  
- Demonstrates censorship-resistant infrastructure that survives tracker shutdowns — a frontier concept aligned with the track’s focus on unconventional Ethereum intersections

Secondary possible tags (if allowed):  
- Devtopia (Infrastructure Frontier)  
- ETHERSPACE (User-Owned Internet – reputation ownership & portability)

## 3. Submission Recommendations

1. **Devfolio Track Selection**  
   - Main track: **Futurllama**  
   - Additional bounties to tag: **0g Labs (Developer Tooling)** + **ADI Foundation (Open)**

2. **Key Demo Highlight** (include in description & video)  
   - Live “kill the server → reputation still intact” demonstration  
   - This is the single most powerful visual proof of the paper’s central claim

3. **Project Description Opening Line (recommended)**  
   “PBTS MVP is a faithful 4-day implementation of the Persistent BitTorrent Trackers scheme (arXiv:2511.17260v2), solving non-portable reputation, centralized fragility, and unverifiable statistics in private trackers using on-chain reputation and cryptographic attestations.”
